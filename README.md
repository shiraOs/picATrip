### **Who are we?**

   **picATrip** is a web platform for **sharing experiences from _trips_** in a form of **photos** based
   on various parameters as:
* Location
* Duration time
* Difficulty

 #### Other features It provides:
* A trip **search functionality** by areas
* **Commenting functionality** for trips shared on the platform

   **picATrip** allows users to have the opportunity to **contribute their trip experience** and thoughts by
   **pic**king  a picture of a **trip** shared on the platform, and by that **learn about the trips**
   which stands behind the pictures, and having the opportunity to **share their thoughts** and **comment** if they desire.

### Why using us?
  **Have you ever heard of the phrase 'eating with the eyes'?** well that's about it! we believe in outdoor lifestyle and trips,
  and we strive to promote and encourage people to share their experience of trips in a form of a photo, only then when a user had
  an interest in a trip picture, he would be capable of getting more information about the trip, and comment his thoughts about it.

  On days where we spending most of our time indoors, staring at screens, and being glued to our chair, whether it's as part of
  our studies, work, or as part of binging a series on the couch.
  We desire to change it and as wiser people have said- a photo worth a thousand words,
  then what's better than a thousand words to describe an experience of a trip.

### Still not convinced?
 As my mom used to say to me as a picky eater- _" try first, and then we'll discuss it, what do you have to lose?"_
